  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin
  -- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
  { 'folke/todo-comments.nvim', event = 'VimEnter', dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }, opts = { signs = false } },

      --  - yinq - [Y]ank [I]nside [N]ext [Q]uote
      --  - ci'  - [C]hange [I]nside [']quote
      require('mini.ai').setup { n_lines = 500 }

      -- Add/delete/replace surroundings (brackets, quotes, etc.)

      -- - saiw) - [S]urround [A]dd [I]nner [W]ord [)]Paren
      -- - sd'   - [S]urround [D]elete [']quotes
      -- - sr)'  - [S]urround [R]eplace [)] [']
      require('mini.surround').setup()

      -- Simple and easy statusline.
      --  You could remove this setup call if you don't like it,
      --  and try some other statusline plugin
      local statusline = require 'mini.statusline'
      -- set use_icons to true if you have a Nerd Font
      statusline.setup { use_icons = vim.g.have_nerd_font }

      -- You can configure sections in the statusline by overriding their
      -- default behavior. For example, here we set the section for
      -- cursor location to LINE:COLUMN
      ---@diagnostic disable-next-line: duplicate-set-field
      statusline.section_location = function()
        return '%2l:%-2v'
